## EXAM QUESTION

You are required to build such an application, including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You are provided with a
&nbsp;
(i) JSON file with all of Co’s sneaker purchases so far and a 
&nbsp;
(ii) JS file with the sneaker information already loaded as a variable. You can choose to make use of either one.
In other words,
(i) you can read in the JSON file into your project, or
(ii) use the JS file with the sneaker data already stored as a variable. The file contains the following variables
* Brand: Brand of the sneaker
* Style: The style of the sneaker
* Color: Color of the sneaker
* Date: Date the sneaker was purchased
* Price: Price paid in South African Rand
You are required to develop a single web page which allows Co to view with his sneaker purchase history. The page should have two main features.
1. The user should be able to view their existing sneaker collection
* Present the user’s sneaker information in tabular form or any other representation you deem appropriate
* The table should be searchable and allow the user to sort on columns
2. The user should be able to add purchases to their sneaker collection
* Each time a user purchases a new pair of sneakers, they should have some way to record these transactions.
* You should provide the functionality to accept the required information
* Importantly, make sure that the user provides the relevant information in the correct format
  * For example, the user cannot include an alphabetic character in the price field
  * Print appropriate messages to the user when the information provided does not meet the required format. 
  * Also, print an appropriate message if the user fails to provide certain information
  * Only allow the user to submit information once it adheres to the required format
* Once the user submits the required information, append it to the table showing the user’s sneaker collection
* Note: you do not need to implement the contents of the JSON file as a database and all variables can live locally in the JS browser.
